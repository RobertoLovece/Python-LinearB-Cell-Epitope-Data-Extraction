            <Abstract>Monoclonal antibody (mAb) #1-30-44 recognized an acid-sensitive conformational epitope of rabies virus glycoprotein (G). The antigenicity of G protein exposed on the cell surface was lost when the infected cells were exposed to pH 5.8. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequence of G protein between the HEP-Flury strain and the epitope-negative CVS strain as well as the mAb-resistant escape mutants, two distant sites that contained Lys-202 and Asn-336 were shown to be involved in the epitope formation. Lys-202 is located in the so-called neurotoxin-like sequence, while Asn-336 is included in antigenic site III and is very near the amino acid at position 333, which is known to affect greatly the neuropathogenicity of rabies virus when changed. Consistent with this finding, antigenicity of a neurovirulent revertant of the HEP-Flury strain, in which Gln-333 of G protein was replaced by Arg, was also affected as shown by its greatly decreased reactivity with mAb #1-30-44 compared to that of the original avirulent HEP virus. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the neurotoxin-like domain and some amino acids in antigenic site III come into contact with each other to form a conformational epitope for mAb #1-30-44, and such a configuration would be lost when exposed to acidic conditions to perform a certain low pH-dependent function of G protein.</Abstract>

                <EpitopeComments>Acid-sensitive conformational epitope.  Conformational epitope consists of residues in two distinct regions:  K202 is located in the neurotoxin-like sequence and N336 is located in the Antigenic Site III (residues 333-338).  Epitope was determined from Ab binding data of site-directed point mutants and viral-escape mutants of HEP-FLURY strain of rabies.</EpitopeComments>
